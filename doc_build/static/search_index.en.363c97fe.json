[{"id":0,"title":"Application","content":"#\n\nIn Express.js applications, the app object is the main entry point for defining\nroutes and middleware. It provides methods to handle HTTP requests, set up\nmiddleware, and manage application settings.\n\nIn ReScript, you can create an Express application using the express function.\nThe app object is a central part of your application.\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nProperties#\n\n\napp.locals#\n\nAn object for storing local variables that are scoped to the request and\nresponse objects.\n\nReScript Signature:\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\napp.mountpath#\n\nThe path on which the app is mounted. This is useful when your application is\npart of a larger application or when using sub-applications.\n\nReScript Signature:\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\napp.router#\n\nThe router object for the application. This is used to define routes and\nmiddleware.\n\nReScript Signature:\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nEvents#\n\n\napp.on('mount', callback(parent))#\n\nEmitted when the app is mounted on a parent app. The parent argument is the\nparent application.\n\nReScript Signature:\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nMethods#\n\nThe app object provides several methods to define routes and handlers for\nspecific HTTP methods. On this section will cover the data types used to define\nroutes and handlers and middlewares.\n\n\napiRoute type#\n\nHelps to define the type of route that can be used in the app methods.\n\nReScript Signature:\n\n\n\n * Path(string): This the most common case, where the route is defined by a\n   string path. For example, Path(\"/users\").\n * ListPath(array<string>): This allows defining a route with multiple string\n   paths. For example, ListPath([\"/users\", \"/admins\"]).\n * PathMatch(RegExp.t): This allows defining a route that matches a regular\n   expression. For example, PathMatch(%re(\"/\\/users\\/\\d+/\")).\n\nNOTE\n\nThe %re(RegExp) is a ReScript decorator that allows you to create a regular\nexpression. It is used to define routes that match specific patterns. For more\ninformation, see the ReScript documentation on Regular Expressions.\n\n\napp.all(path, callback [, callback ...])#\n\nDefines a route for all HTTP methods at the specified path. This is useful for\nhandling requests that do not match any other routes.\n\nReScript Signature:\n\n\n\nParameters:\n\n * path: It is an @unboxed variant that can create a route bases on a string, an\n   array<string>, or a RegExp.t.

In addition\nto check in more details the parameters and functions, you can also refer to the\nExpress.js documentation for more information.\n\n\nexpress()#\n\nDescription: Creates an Express application. The express() function is a\ntop-level function exported by the express module.\n\nTo start a new Express application, in JavaScript or TypeScript, it's as simple\nas:\n\nIn ReScript, you can do the same with:\n\nNOTE\n\nIn ReScript open Express helps to reduce the boiler plate of writting the module\nin each usage of a function.\n\nWARNING\n\nIt's preferable using the express function, as Node.js now supports ESM imports.\nThe expressCjs function is provided only for backward compatibility with older\nNode.js versions.\n\n\nMiddlewares#\n\nExpress middlewares are functions that process incoming requests before they\nreach your route handlers. They can parse request bodies, serve static files, or\nhandle errors. Below are the most common middlewares and their ReScript\nbindings:\n\n\nexpress.json([options])#\n\nParses incoming requests with JSON payloads and makes the data available on\nreq.body. Use this middleware when you expect clients to send JSON data (e.g.,\nfrom a frontend app).\n\nReScript Signature:\n\n\n\nParameters:\n\n * ~options: Optional configuration object to customize the JSON parsing\n   behavior.\n\nReturns a middleware function that can be used in your Express app.\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nexpress.raw([options])#\n\nParses incoming requests with a raw body buffer and makes it available on\nreq.body. This is useful for handling binary uploads or custom body formats.\n\nReScript Signature:\n\n\n\nParameters:\n\n * ~options: Optional configuration object to customize the raw body parsing\n   behavior.\n\nReturns a middleware function that can be used in your Express app.\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nexpress.Router([options])#\n\nCreates a new router object to modularize your route definitions. Routers help\norganize your application by grouping related routes and middleware.\n\nReScript Signature:\n\n\n\nParameters:\n\n * ~options: Optional configuration object to customize the router behavior.\n\nReturns a new router instance that can be used to define routes and middleware.\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nexpress.static(root, [options])#\n\nServes static files such as images, CSS, and JavaScript from a directory. This\nmiddleware is commonly used to serve assets for your frontend.\n\nReScript Signature:\n\n\n\nParameters:\n\n * root: The root directory from which to serve static files.\n * ~options: Optional configuration object to customize the static file serving\n   behavior.\n\nReturns a middleware function that can be used in your Express app.\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nexpress.text([options])#\n\nParses incoming requests with plain text payloads and makes the text available\non req.body. Use this when you expect plain text data (not JSON or form data).\n\nReScript Signature:\n\n\n\nParameters:\n\n * ~options: Optional configuration object to customize the text parsing\n   behavior.\n\nReturns a middleware function that can be used in your Express app.\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nexpress.urlencoded([options])#\n\nParses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads (as from HTML forms) and\nexposes the data on req.body. Use this middleware for traditional form\nsubmissions.\n\nReScript Signature:\n\n\n\nParameters:\n\n * ~options: Optional configuration object to customize the URL-encoded parsing\n   behavior.\n\nReturns a middleware function that can be used in your Express app.\n\nExample:\n\n","routePath":"/api/express","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"`express()`","id":"express-1","depth":2,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"Middlewares","id":"middlewares","depth":2,"charIndex":785},{"text":"`express.json([options])`","id":"expressjsonoptions","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"`express.raw([options])`","id":"expressrawoptions","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"`express.Router([options])`","id":"expressrouteroptions","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"`express.static(root, [options])`","id":"expressstaticroot-options","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"`express.text([options])`","id":"expresstextoptions","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"`express.urlencoded([options])`","id":"expressurlencodedoptions","depth":3,"charIndex":-1}],"domain":"","frontmatter":{},"version":""},{"id":2,"title":"Compile and Run ReScript Code","content":"#\n\nNow that you have finished writting your ReScript, it is to be used in a\nJavaScript runtime or the browser.

However, the file (or files) are may not be ready to be used in\n    the browser or a JavaScript environment yet, so you need to bundle them. You\n    can do this by adding any bundler of your choice, such as esbuild, rollup,\n    rsbuild, or webpack.\n\nFor this tutorial, we will use rolldown, which is a bundler that is easy to use\nand has a good performance.
